   * argument to the {@code throw} statement to avoid compiler errors regarding no return statement and similar
   * problems. This method won't of course return an actual {@code RuntimeException} - it never returns, it always
   * throws the provided exception.
   * 
   * @param t The throwable to throw without requiring you to catch its type.
   * @return A dummy RuntimeException; this method never returns normally, it <em>always</em> throws an exception!
